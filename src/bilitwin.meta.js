 * BiliTwin consists of two parts - BiliMonkey and BiliPolyfill. 
 * They are bundled because I am too lazy to write two user interfaces.
 * 
 * So what is the difference between BiliMonkey and BiliPolyfill?
 * 
 * BiliMonkey deals with network. It is a (naIve) Service Worker. 
 * This is also why it uses IndexedDB instead of localStorage.
 * BiliPolyfill deals with experience. It is more a "user script". 
 * Everything it can do can be done by hand.
 * 
 * BiliPolyfill will be pointless in the long run - I believe bilibili 
 * will finally provide these functions themselves.
